# Forgejo CLI v2 implementation specification

Provide polished collaboration and repository commands plus a safe generic `/api/v1/` escape hatch. The CLI must require confirmation for mutations, produce credential-free dry-run plans, encode path segments, and keep JSON stdout machine-readable.

Acceptance: tests verify help, mutation gating, generic path validation, JSON plans, repository creation without owner/repo, and representative issue, PR, release, content, and webhook requests. Live transport tests must cover multipart or form delivery, caller-provided authentication, response pagination metadata, missing-server failure, and nested content paths. Documentation must explain version-aware Swagger discovery, scope-aware authentication, pagination, and when a generic endpoint is the appropriate choice.
