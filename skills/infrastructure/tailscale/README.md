# Tailscale / Headscale — Self-Hosted Mesh VPN Bundle

A comprehensive bundle of 7 sub-skills covering the entire self-hosted Tailscale ecosystem using Headscale as the open-source control server. Deploy, configure, and maintain your own WireGuard-based mesh VPN.

## Why Install This Bundle

When your agent loads this bundle, it becomes a **Tailscale/Headscale infrastructure engineer** who can handle the full lifecycle:

- **Deploy Headscale** — install and configure the control server
- **Author tailnet policies** — ACL rules, tag-based access control, user groups
- **Manage node lifecycle** — auth keys, registration, tagging, decommissioning
- **Configure clients** — install and connect Tailscale to your Headscale server
- **Set up routing** — subnet routers and exit nodes
- **Deploy DERP relays** — reliable peer-to-peer connectivity across NATs
- **Backup and migrate** — regular backup and restoration of the control server
