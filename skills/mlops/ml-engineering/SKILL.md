# ML Engineering Methodology

Machine learning engineering is the bridge between model research and production systems. This methodology covers the engineering disciplines needed to train, evaluate, deploy, and maintain ML models reliably.

## The ML Engineer's Domain

| You own | You don't own |
|---------|--------------|
| Model training — LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning, full fine-tuning, distributed training | Statistical modeling and experimental design — that's the data scientist |
| Model evaluation — benchmark suites, custom eval sets, regression testing | Causal inference and hypothesis testing — that's the data scientist |
| Quantization — GGUF, GPTQ, AWQ, bitsandbytes | Training data collection and labeling — that's the data/ML ops team |
| Inference serving — [vLLM](../vllm/SKILL.md), [llama.cpp](../llama-cpp/SKILL.md), TGI, Triton | Business metrics and KPI definition — that's the product manager |
| Evaluation harness — lm-eval-harness, custom pipelines | Data pipeline architecture — that's the data engineer |
| Model deployment — containerization, versioning, A/B testing | Infrastructure provisioning — that's the platform engineer |

## Reference Files

| Reference | When to load |
|-----------|-------------|
| `references/fine-tuning.md` | Setting up a LoRA/QLoRA/ full fine-tuning run — data prep, hyperparameters, validation strategy |
| `references/evaluation.md` | Evaluating a model — benchmark selection, custom eval sets, regression tracking, comparison methodology |
| `references/quantization-inference.md` | Quantizing a model and serving it — GGUF/GPTQ/AWQ/bitsandbytes comparison, calibration data strategies, KV cache quantization, vLLM/llama.cpp/TGI/Triton architecture, production considerations |
| `references/training-infrastructure.md` | Selecting and provisioning training infrastructure — GPU selection, VRAM budgeting, multi-GPU strategies (DDP/FSDP/DeepSpeed), cloud vs on-prem, storage, monitoring |

## Templates

| Template | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `templates/training-run-record.md` | Recording a training or fine-tuning run — model and data versions, full config, environment, eval results — so it can be reproduced |
| `templates/eval-regression-table.md` | Tracking model quality across runs and triaging a regression — one row per eval case or capability subset |
| `templates/quantization-decision-record.md` | Recording a quantization decision — baseline, candidates compared, quality threshold, and rollback path |

## Scripts

| Script | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `scripts/check-eval-overlap.py` | Checking a training corpus against an eval corpus for test-set leakage (shared n-grams); `--json` for CI, exit 1 when an eval file exceeds the overlap threshold |

## Evals

`evals/evals.json` — output-quality eval manifest for this skill: fine-tuning plan review, eval-set design, quantization decision, deployment plan, regression triage, and training-run reproducibility.

## Core Principles

**Measure before you optimize** — Never quantize, prune, or distill a model without first measuring its baseline performance. Optimization without measurement is guessing.

**Reproducibility is non-negotiable** — Every training run needs a reproducible config: seed, data version, hyperparameters, and evaluation methodology. If you can't reproduce it, you can't ship it.

**Baseline first** — Before running an expensive fine-tuning run, establish a baseline with the base model. If the base model is already good enough, the fine-tuning budget is better spent elsewhere.

**Test at the boundary** — Model evaluation is most informative at the edges of the capability distribution, not at the center. Hard examples reveal more than easy ones.

**The evaluation set is a liability** — Every example in your eval set is a potential test-set leak. Use held-out sets, rotate examples, and periodically audit for contamination with the overlap checker.

## When not to use

Do not use this skill for statistical modeling, experimental design, or causal inference — that's the data scientist's discipline. Do not use it to operate a specific inference engine: for llama.cpp installation, model loading, benchmarking, and troubleshooting, load the [llama-cpp](../llama-cpp/SKILL.md) tool skill instead; for vLLM deployment, model configuration, benchmarking, batching tuning, GPU operation, and upgrade/rollback, load the [vllm](../vllm/SKILL.md) tool skill instead. This skill provides the methodology (eval-set design, quantization trade-offs, deployment plans, regression triage); the tool skills own the runbooks.
