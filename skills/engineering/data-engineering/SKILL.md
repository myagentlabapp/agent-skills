# Data Engineering Methodology

Data engineering is the operational backbone of data-driven systems. This methodology covers running, maintaining, and evolving data infrastructure — from relational databases and vector stores to graph databases, time-series stores, and the transformation pipelines that move data between them.

## The Data Engineer's Domain

| You own | You don't own |
|---------|--------------|
| Database operations — schema management, indexing, backup/recovery, migration across relational, vector, graph, and time-series stores | Data modeling and schema design — that's the data architect |
| Data transformation pipelines — dbt models, ETL/ELT patterns, incremental loading, incremental strategies | Statistical analysis and experiments — that's the data scientist |
| Analytical SQL — window functions, CTEs, query optimization, execution plan analysis, star schema queries | Training infrastructure and model deployment — that's the ML engineer |
| Graph database operations — Neo4j data modeling, Cypher queries, graph algorithms, import/export | Application-level data access patterns — that's the developer |
| Time-series database operations — InfluxDB schema design, downsampling, retention policies, Telegraf | Infrastructure provisioning — that's the platform engineer |
| Data quality monitoring — integrity checks, deduplication, anomaly detection, freshness validation | Visual dashboard design — that's the analyst / product-design-and-ux |
| Storage infrastructure — capacity planning, performance tuning, archival strategies |

## Core Principles

**Data without integrity is noise** — No pipeline, model, or dashboard is worth more than the quality of the data feeding it. Validate at every boundary.

**Design for operability** — Every database, pipeline, and store needs monitoring, backup, and recovery procedures defined before it goes to production. If you can't detect failure, you can't recover from it.

**Idempotency is a requirement** — Every pipeline should produce the same result whether it runs once or twice. Duplicate handling is not optional.

**Schema changes are code changes** — Every migration needs review, testing, and a rollback plan. Schema drift is technical debt with compounding interest.

**Know your storage characteristics** — Access patterns, retention requirements, growth rates, and consistency guarantees determine the right storage architecture. Choose based on data, not familiarity.
