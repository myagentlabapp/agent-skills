name: extract-decisions
description: Extract structured design decisions from a technical document. Reads the document, identifies architectural choice points, interviews the author to fill gaps, and writes complete decision frameworks as markdown and JSONL files. Use when you have a design guide, architecture spec, or technical document and want to capture its decision knowledge in a form AI systems can reason over.

# Design Decision Extraction

Extract the design decisions embedded in a technical document. Each decision captures the alternatives, the conditions under which you'd choose each, the trade-offs, the implications, and the evidence — structured so AI systems can reason over them.

## Overview

This skill runs a five-phase workflow:

1. **Inventory** — Read the document and identify all architectural choice points
2. **Filter** — Present candidates; user removes any that aren't worth capturing
3. **Gap Analysis** — Assess which of the 5 decision elements exist in the document vs. need to be filled in
4. **Elicitation** — Interview the user one question at a time to fill the gaps
5. **Synthesis & Output** — Write complete decision frameworks to disk as markdown + JSONL

## Starting the Workflow

Ask the user for the document path if they haven't provided one. Then begin Phase 1.

---

## Session State

All state is persisted in `{output_dir}/session.json`. Write this file using the Write tool. Update it after every phase transition and after every elicitation answer — do not buffer updates.

**Schema:**
```json
{
  "source_doc": "filename.pdf",
  "output_dir": "./output/",
  "phase": "elicitation",
  "candidates": [
    {"id": "decision_001", "question": "...", "alternatives": ["A", "B"], "source_sections": ["..."]}
  ],
  "assessments": {
    "decision_001": {
      "alternatives": {"status": "SUFFICIENT", "source_excerpt": "...", "questions": ["..."]},
      "conditions":   {"status": "WEAK",       "source_excerpt": "...", "questions": ["..."]},
      "tradeoffs":    {"status": "ABSENT",      "source_excerpt": "",   "questions": ["..."]},
      "implications": {"status": "ABSENT",      "source_excerpt": "",   "questions": ["..."]},
      "evidence":     {"status": "WEAK",        "source_excerpt": "...", "questions": ["..."]}
    }
  },
  "elicitation_answers": {
    "decision_001": {
      "alternatives": "user answer or 'skipped' or 'deferred' or 'in the doc'",
      "conditions": "user answer"
    }
  },
  "completed_decisions": ["decision_001"]
}
```

**Write rules:**
- Set `phase` to: `inventory`, `filter`, `gap_analysis`, `elicitation`, `synthesis`, or `complete`
- After the filter phase, `candidates` contains only the user-approved list
- After gap analysis, `assessments` is fully populated
- After every elicitation answer (including skip/defer/in the doc), write the updated `elicitation_answers` immediately
- After each decision is synthesized, append its id to `completed_decisions`

---

## Tools and Dependencies

**This skill requires no external tools, Python packages, or shell commands.** Use only Claude Code's built-in tools:

- **Read** — reads documents directly. Handles PDF, markdown, and plain text natively. Never install pdfplumber, pypdf, or any other library to read documents.
- **Write** — writes output files.
- **Bash** — only for checking whether a file or directory exists (`ls`, `test -f`). Not for document parsing.

**PDF-specific rules:**
- Use `Read` with the `pages` parameter for large PDFs: `pages: "1-10"`, `pages: "11-20"`, etc. Maximum 20 pages per call.
- For PDFs over 20 pages, read in 20-page batches and combine the text yourself before analysis.
- Never use Python or shell tools to extract PDF text.

---

## Phase 1: Inventory

Read the document using the Read tool. If the document is very large (over 800 lines for text files, or over 20 pages for PDFs), read it in sections.

Then identify design decision candidates by thinking like a **Network Architecture and Design Analyst**:

A valid design decision:
- Involves choosing between 2 or more viable alternatives
- Has situations or conditions where you'd choose one over another
- Affects deployment architecture (not just operations or troubleshooting)
- Is discussed or implied in the document

Look for:
- Technology selection (X vs Y)
- Deployment topology choices (centralized vs distributed, active-active vs standby)
- Redundancy and failover strategies
- Control plane or data plane design choices
- Scaling strategies
- Integration approaches
- Component placement (on-prem vs cloud)
- Transport and connectivity choices

Skip purely operational content (how to run or maintain something after it's deployed).

For each candidate, note:
- A draft question framing the choice ("Should you use X or Y?" or "When to use X vs Y?")
- The alternatives you identified
- Where in the document it appears
- Your confidence (high / medium / low) and a brief reason

After identifying candidates, write `session.json` with `phase: "filter"` and the full `candidates` list before presenting them to the user.

---

## Phase 2: Filter

Present the candidates as a numbered table:

```
#  | Decision                          | Alternatives          | Confidence
---|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------
1  | Should you use X or Y?            | X, Y                  | ● high
2  | When to use centralized vs dist.? | Centralized, Dist.    | ◐ medium
```

Legend: ● high  ◐ medium  ◑ low

Tell the user the total count and ask them to remove any they don't want to capture. They can specify:
- Single numbers: `3`
- Ranges: `1-5`
- Mixed: `1-3, 5, 7-9`

Confirm the final list before proceeding. Then update `session.json`: replace `candidates` with only the approved list and set `phase: "gap_analysis"`.

---

## Phase 3: Gap Analysis

For each selected candidate, assess it as a **Gap Analyst**:

The five required decision elements are:
1. **alternatives** — Are the 2+ alternatives each described with purpose, characteristics, and contrast?
2. **conditions** — Are the conditions where you'd choose each alternative explicitly explained and quantified?
3. **tradeoffs** — Are the trade-offs between alternatives (cost, complexity, flexibility, etc.) documented?
4. **implications** — Are the downstream consequences of each choice clear?
5. **evidence** — Is there evidence, examples, or validation for the guidance?

Classify each element:
- **SUFFICIENT** — source contains synthesis-ready detail
- **WEAK** — partial content but vague, unquantified, or incomplete
- **ABSENT** — nothing usable in the document

For every element (SUFFICIENT, WEAK, or ABSENT), prepare elicitation questions:
- SUFFICIENT: 1 expansion question
- WEAK: 2–3 targeted questions to fill gaps
- ABSENT: 2–3 targeted questions

For every element, draft a model pre-answer from your own training knowledge. This will be shown to the expert during elicitation so they can confirm, correct, or expand rather than answer from scratch. Label these clearly as model pre-answers — the expert must know this is not from the document.

Before showing the gap summary, write `session.json` with `phase: "elicitation"` and the fully-populated `assessments` object.

Show the user a brief gap summary before starting elicitation:

```
Decision 1: Should you use X or Y?
  ✓ alternatives (sufficient)   ? conditions (weak)   ✗ tradeoffs (absent)
  ✗ implications (absent)       ✓ evidence (sufficient)
  → ~6 questions estimated
```

---

## Phase 4: Elicitation

Work through each decision one at a time. For each decision:

1. Show a one-line header: `Decision 2/5 — "Should you use X or Y?" — Question 3/7`
2. Before asking, always show the model's pre-trained understanding of this element, clearly labeled as `Model's pre-trained understanding (not from the document):`. Then, for SUFFICIENT and WEAK elements, also show the relevant source excerpt as supporting context. Always ask two things: (1) is the model's understanding correct, incomplete, or wrong? (2) what would you add that the model wouldn't know?
   - The source excerpt (for SUFFICIENT/WEAK) is context only — never ask the expert to confirm whether the document is accurate
   - This distinction matters so the expert knows they are validating AI knowledge, not source content
3. Ask one question and wait for the answer before asking the next

**User commands to accept at any prompt:**
- Any answer — record it in `elicitation_answers`, write `session.json`, then move to the next question
- `skip` — record `"skipped"` for this element, write `session.json`, move on
- `defer` — record `"deferred"` for this element, write `session.json`, move on
- `in the doc` — record `"in the doc"` for this element, write `session.json`, move on
- `save` — write `session.json` (it should already be current), confirm to the user, and continue
- `quit` — write `session.json` and stop; tell the user to run `/extract-decisions resume` to continue

**Every answer must be written to disk before asking the next question. Never accumulate answers in memory and write them later.**

After all questions for a decision are complete, show the user a summary of their answers and ask if they want to correct anything before synthesis.

**Key rule: one question at a time. Never present multiple questions together.**

---

## Phase 5: Synthesis and Output

For each completed decision, act as a **Decision Framework Synthesizer**:

Write a complete, self-contained decision framework. Every sentence must stand alone — no references to other sections, figures, or external documents.

**Writing rules:**
- Write in clear, direct prose — no marketing language
- Quantify conditions where possible ("more than 100 branches" not "large deployments")
- Name trade-offs with their conditions and impact
- Explain downstream consequences and which decisions they affect
- Include examples, validation results, or real-world outcomes for evidence
- Annotate every sentence with its origin: `[S]` source-derived, `[E]` elicited (includes expert-confirmed model pre-answers), `[I]` inferred and not validated by the expert
- Minimum content: 1–2 sentences per alternative, 1–2 sentences per condition, 1–2 sentences per implication, 2+ sentences for evidence
- No placeholder dashes, no `[MISSING: ...]` markers — every section must have substantive content

**Decision framework format:**

```markdown
**Decision Question:** [The architectural choice point]

**Alternatives:**
- **[Alternative 1]:** [1-2 sentences: what it is, purpose, key characteristics] [S/E/I]
- **[Alternative 2]:** [1-2 sentences: what it is, purpose, key characteristics] [S/E/I]

**When to Use Each Alternative:**
- **[Alternative 1]:** [Conditions/situations, quantified where possible] [S/E/I]
- **[Alternative 2]:** [Conditions/situations, quantified where possible] [S/E/I]

**Trade-offs:**
- **[Alt 1 vs Alt 2]:** [Cost, complexity, flexibility, performance — with conditions] [S/E/I]

**Implications:**
- **[If you choose Alt 1]:** [Downstream decisions and consequences] [S/E/I]
- **[If you choose Alt 2]:** [Downstream decisions and consequences] [S/E/I]

Rule: every alternative must have its own implication entry. For every constraint or limitation named in Trade-offs, carry it forward into Implications as "when this limitation becomes relevant, here is what the organization does instead."

**Evidence:** [Examples, validation results, real-world outcomes] [S/E/I]
```

After writing, re-read every sentence and flag any that reference something outside the framework itself.

**Write the output immediately after each decision is synthesized** — don't wait until all decisions are complete. After writing each decision's files, append its id to `completed_decisions` in `session.json` and write the updated session file.

### Output files

Write to the directory the user specifies (default: `./output/`):

**Per decision — markdown file** (`output/<decision-id>.md`):
The full decision framework with `[S]`/`[E]`/`[I]` annotations.

**Aggregate JSONL file** (`output/rag/chunks.jsonl`):
One JSON object per line, one per section per decision. Append as each decision completes.

```json
{"decision_id": "decision_001", "decision_question": "Should you use X or Y?", "section": "alternatives", "text": "Alternative 1 is... Alternative 2 is...", "source_doc": "filename.pdf", "extracted_date": "2026-05-10", "has_inferred_content": false}
```

Sections: `anchor`, `alternatives`, `when_to_use_each`, `tradeoffs`, `implications`, `evidence`

Strip `[S]`, `[E]`, `[I]` annotations from JSONL text (keep them only in the markdown).
Set `has_inferred_content: true` if any sentence in that section has an `[I]` annotation.

---

## Resuming an Interrupted Session

Ask the user for the output directory (default: `./output/`). Then read `{output_dir}/session.json`.

**If session.json exists**, restore full state from it:
- `source_doc` — what document was being analyzed
- `candidates` — the filtered list (skip inventory and filter phases)
- `assessments` — the gap analysis (skip gap analysis phase)
- `elicitation_answers` — answers already recorded (skip those questions)
- `completed_decisions` — decisions already synthesized (skip those entirely)

Show the user a resume summary before continuing:
```
Resuming session for: filename.pdf
Completed decisions (2): decision_001, decision_003
In-progress: decision_002 — 3 of 7 questions answered
Remaining: decision_004, decision_005
```

Then continue from where it left off:
- For decisions in `completed_decisions`: skip entirely
- For the in-progress decision: skip elements that already have answers in `elicitation_answers`, continue with the first unanswered element
- For decisions not yet started: run gap analysis if assessment is missing, then elicitation

**If session.json does not exist**, look for `.md` files in the output directory to identify completed decisions, then ask the user what document to continue with and which decisions remain to be processed.

**Never re-ask questions that already have answers in `elicitation_answers`**, even if the answer is `"skipped"` or `"deferred"`.

---

## Output Summary

When all decisions are complete, report:
- How many decision frameworks were written
- Where the files are
- Total questions asked vs. answered
- Any decisions that have inferred content (flag for expert review)
