- Add enterprise invoice as an explicit optional domain for metro scenarios, including installation, orchestration, shared routing, and aggregate validation.

- Add project-type inference and existing-project integration contract rules for safer incremental adoption.
- Improve code generation guardrails for SDK preflight, interface evidence, fail-closed integration points, message routing, and aggregate validation.
- Add optional extension installation support while keeping non-selected extensions silent by default.
- Refresh bundled domain Skill ZIP files and validator regression coverage.

## 0.1.0

- Establish the version baseline for the enterprise scenario integration Skill.
- Support single-scenario enterprise-code integration across EC, expense-control, and bill domains.
