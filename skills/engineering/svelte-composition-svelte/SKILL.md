# composition-svelte

Decompose a Svelte 5 feature by ROLE. Wrong role assignment is the root cause of every architectural fuckup. Before generating files, pin three decisions: composition shape, snippet API, state location. Per-file contracts fall out from those.

Rules from `frontend:code-style`, `svelte-5:code-style-svelte`, `frontend:editing`, `svelte:svelte-code-writer`, `svelte:svelte-core-bestpractices` apply throughout. Run `mcp__svelte__svelte-autofixer` after every `.svelte` edit.

## When to use

- Designing a wrapper / Provider-style component (popup, menu, drawer, modal, tooltip, panel, slide-in, accordion)
- Autofixer flagged `bind:this`
- About to type `$effect(() => { new ThirdPartyThing(...) })`
- About to write `prop={appState.x}` or `prop={someStore.value}`
- Naming a new file `Default.svelte` / `Feature.svelte` / `Wrapper.svelte`
- Calling `setDOMContent` / `appendChild(svelteRenderedNode)` / similar
- Deciding default vs named snippets
- Fixing a focus / ESC / keyboard bug in one of several similar menus
- About to add a maplibre `Marker`, leaflet `L.marker`, d3 selection
- About to type `:global(...)` inside a wrapper's `<style>` block

Skip for: CSS-only tweaks, test-only edits, backend / non-Svelte work.

## Pin three decisions first

Answer in writing BEFORE generating files. Full tables and pointers in `references/decisions.md`.

1. **Shape**: Composition shape / Non-Svelte Host?
2. **Snippet API**: default `children`, named snippets, or mix?
3. **State location**: where each piece of state lives. Options can coexist; pick what fits each piece. `.svelte.ts` modules (module-level `$state` exports, classes with `$state` fields), component-local `$state`, context (`createContext`), existing global state.

If intent is ambiguous, ask via `AskUserQuestion`, never infer silently.

## Naming

- **Files** by ROLE. `Default.svelte` alone is too vague: `DefaultItems.svelte` reads. `Feature.svelte` / `Wrapper.svelte` are banned for new code.
- **Function verbs**: `subscribeX/unsubscribeX` for event subscription; `attachX/detachX` for Svelte `{@attach}` lifecycle; `mountX/unmountX` for component lifecycle; `createX/destroyX` for factory pairs. Don't conflate.
- **Variables** per `frontend:code-style`: `element` not `el`; `event` not `e`; `result` not `res`.
- **Utils** grouped by CATEGORY (`$utils/domActions.ts` for all DOM attachments). NOT one file per export.

## Util extraction

When a pattern appears in 2+ components, extract to `$utils/<category>.ts`. Don't pre-extract, first use is inline; second triggers the move.

## Tooling

Delegate creating, editing, or reviewing any `.svelte` / `.svelte.ts` / `.svelte.js` file to the `svelte:svelte-file-editor` subagent (per `agent:before-you-act` "Consider before doing it yourself"), multi-file refactors most of all. The subagent runs in its own context window, so its docs lookup (`mcp__svelte__get-documentation`) and autofixer iteration (`mcp__svelte__svelte-autofixer`) don't spend the main agent's context.

## Symmetric bugs

UX bugs in overlay-style components almost always span ALL overlay-style components. On fix: grep for analogous (`role="menu"`, `tabindex="-1"`, `onkeydown.*Escape`), confirm, apply symmetrically in the same change, test both.

## Done close-path matrix

Overlay-specific. Other feature types (forms, tables, panels without close behaviour) need their own done-matrix, write one local to that feature, mirroring this structure (interactions and their expected post-state, exit paths, regression neighbours). Before declaring an overlay feature done, run ALL of these in a real browser via Playwright MCP:

- [ ] X / close button: wrapper popup + auxiliary elements both cleared
- [ ] click-outside / `closeOnClick`: both cleared
- [ ] ESC: both cleared
- [ ] Each interactive child click: both cleared
- [ ] Opening another overlay of the same kind: opens through the Controller's handler, which closes the prior overlay automatically (see `references/composition-shape.md` Controller)
- [ ] Analogous components have the same UX behaviour
- [ ] `mcp__svelte__svelte-autofixer`: zero new issues. `$effect calling function` advisories on imperative third-party calls are OK; `bind:this` suggestions are NOT.
- [ ] Vitest: green for the file + regression neighbours
- [ ] Lint, type check: no new warnings/errors

Per `agent:done`: declaring done before this matrix is fraudulent. Per `agent:asshole`: don't dismiss failures as "not my problem".

## Red flags: STOP and reconsider

| Red flag | Means | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prop={appState.x}` / `prop={someStore.value}` | Prop-drilling a global | Import the store, read it directly |
| `bind:this` with `{@attach}` autofixer suggestion | Wrong tool for element augmenters | `references/lifecycle.md` + `references/third-party.md` |
| `Default.svelte` / `Feature.svelte` / `Wrapper.svelte` | Role not conveyed | Role-specific name |
| Third-party library import (maplibre / leaflet / d3 / etc.) inside the markup-only file mounted into a third-party container | Wrong axis | Move bridging to the parent Wrapper. See `references/third-party.md`. |
| `$effect(() => new ThirdPartyThing(...))` for one-shot setup | Wrong rune | `onMount` + cleanup return |
| `$effect` writing to `$state` | Wrong rune | `$derived` |
| Fixing ESC for one menu only | Other menus have the same bug | Symmetric coverage |
| Two overlays visible simultaneously | Opened directly instead of through the Controller's handler | Funnel every open through the Controller's handler, it closes any prior overlay before opening the new one. See `references/composition-shape.md` Controller. |
| Auxiliary element (marker dot, badge, etc.) still visible after popup auto-close | Visibility gated on `popup.isOpen()`, but the third-party lib fires 'close' AFTER `popup.remove()` | Reconcile unconditionally on `open`; `addTo`/`remove` are idempotent |
| Snippet inlined in consumer feels too long | Time to extract | `<script module>` re-export, `references/composition-shape.md` |
| `attachX` named but uses `map.on()` | Verb mismatch | `subscribeX` |
| `:global(button)` in a wrapper's `<style>` | Wrong place to style children | `references/css-scope.md` |
| `el` / `e` / `tmp` variable names | Code-style violation | Rename |

When tempted to rationalize, read `references/rationalizations.md`.
