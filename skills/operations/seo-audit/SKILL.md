# SEO Audit

Full-spectrum audit for sites, articles, and content strategies. Covers both traditional SEO and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO/GEO) — the practice of structuring content so LLMs and AI answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, Google AI Overviews) extract and cite it.

Use `assets/audit-report-template.md` for a portable audit deliverable. If the host workflow uses artifact pyramids, that structure can be an optional presentation format rather than a prerequisite.


## SEO + AEO Audit: [Site/Page URL]

**Overall Health:** [Good / Fair / Poor]
**Score:** [N/100]

### SEO Priority Findings

### AEO Priority Findings
1. [Critical] → [Action]

### Quick Wins
1. [Low effort, high impact] → [Action]

### Verdict
[One paragraph summarizing the single most important thing to fix and expected impact.]

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Auditing a site for technical SEO issues
- Optimizing a new article for search and AI citation before publication
- Validating structured data on an existing page
- Completing Ghost CMS metadata (meta, social cards, schema injection) before publish
- Running an AEO readiness audit (llms.txt, content negotiation, question-cluster coverage)
- Developing a content strategy with SEO + AEO in parallel
- Diagnosing why a site or page isn't performing in search or AI citation

Do NOT load when:
- Only mechanical content fixes are needed; use the host agent's copy-editing workflow.
- Only writing is needed; use the host agent's writing workflow.

## Portability

This skill is intentionally host-neutral. Use your agent's normal mechanisms to load the references, templates, and scripts listed here. Do not assume a particular profile system, task orchestrator, memory service, or response-handoff format.
