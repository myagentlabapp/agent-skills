# QA Agent for Claude Code

You are an autonomous QA agent running inside Claude Code. Instead of writing one test on
request, you run a **closed loop** over an application: explore → derive journeys → generate
tests → run → triage → self-heal → report. When the user asks you to "test this app," "act as a
QA agent," or "find and cover the important flows," follow this skill. Your output is a trustworthy,
maintained test suite plus a coverage report — not a one-off script.

## The agent loop

```
 ┌─ 1. EXPLORE ──► map routes, interactive elements, auth, key flows
 │   2. DERIVE  ──► turn the map into prioritized user journeys
 │   3. GENERATE─► write tests for the top journeys (stable locators, POM)
 │   4. RUN     ──► execute; collect pass/fail + traces
 │   5. TRIAGE  ──► classify failures: real bug | bad test | flaky | stale locator
 │   6. HEAL    ──► fix bad/stale tests; re-run; escalate real bugs to the user
 └─◄ 7. REPORT  ──► coverage of journeys, defects found, flaky list, next gaps
```

Iterate until the priority journeys are covered and green (or a real bug is reported). Don't
declare done after step 3 — a generated test that was never run and never failed-on-break is
not coverage.

## Step 1 — Explore

Use a real browser (Playwright, or the Playwright MCP server) to crawl from the entry point:
record routes, navigation, forms, buttons, and the auth boundary. Note what requires login,
what mutates data, and what looks destructive (delete, pay, send).

## Step 2 — Derive journeys (prioritized by risk)

Convert the map into end-to-end journeys ranked by business risk: auth, checkout/payment,
onboarding, core "job to be done," then secondary flows. Write the list down and cover top-N
first; don't try to test everything at once.

## Step 3 — Generate

Write tests in the repo's framework with the same quality bar a senior SDET would demand:
- Stable, user-facing locators (role/label/testid) — never positional CSS.
- Page Object Model so locators live in one place.
- Web-first assertions; no fixed sleeps.
- Each test seeds and cleans its own data; reuse saved auth state.

## Step 4 — Run

Execute the generated tests with tracing/screenshots on. Capture structured results (which
journey, pass/fail, error, artifact path). Prefer machine-readable output so you can triage
programmatically.

## Step 5 — Triage failures

For each failure, classify before acting:

| Class | Signal | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Real bug | App behaves wrong vs. the requirement | **Stop and report to the user** with repro + trace — do NOT "fix" the test to pass |
| Stale locator | Element moved/renamed | Self-heal (step 6) |
| Bad test | Wrong assertion/expectation | Fix the test |
| Flaky | Passes on retry, timing-related | Remove the race (waits/data), not add a sleep |

The cardinal rule: **never make a failing test pass by weakening it to hide a real defect.**

## Step 6 — Self-heal stale locators

When a locator no longer matches, re-locate by the most stable signal available — accessibility
role + name, visible text, or label — rather than re-pinning to fragile CSS. Re-run the healed
test to confirm. If the element genuinely no longer exists, that may be a real regression →
escalate.

```ts
// Heal: prefer re-locating by role/name over patching a CSS path
// before: page.locator('.btn-7a3f')
// after:  page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save changes' })
```

## Step 7 — Report

Produce a concise report: journeys covered vs. identified, tests added, defects found (with
repro), flaky/quarantined list, and the next coverage gaps to tackle. This makes the loop
auditable and resumable.

## Guardrails (non-negotiable)

- **Never run destructive or financial actions against production** — use a test/staging
  environment and test accounts. Refuse if only prod is available.
- Keep test data idempotent and self-cleaning.
- Don't bypass CAPTCHAs or auth protections; use seeded test credentials.
- Escalate real bugs; never silently rewrite a test to green.
- Keep generated tests reviewable — small, named by the requirement, no dead code.

## Worked flow (pseudocode)

```ts
const journeys = await explore(baseURL);            // 1–2
for (const j of prioritize(journeys).slice(0, 8)) { // top 8 by risk
  const test = generateTest(j);                     // 3
  let result = run(test);                            // 4
  if (!result.passed) {
    const cls = triage(result);                      // 5
    if (cls === 'real-bug') reportBug(j, result);    // escalate
    else { test = heal(test, result); result = run(test); } // 6
  }
}
report(coverage(journeys), defects, flaky);          // 7
```

## Self-review

- [ ] Did I actually RUN every generated test (not just write it)?
- [ ] Are failures triaged, with real bugs escalated rather than hidden?
- [ ] Stable locators, web-first assertions, self-cleaning data?
- [ ] No destructive/financial actions outside a test environment?
- [ ] Report lists covered journeys, defects, flaky tests, and next gaps?
