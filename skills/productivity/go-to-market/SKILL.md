## Output Contract

The profile using this skill produces artifact pyramids. The response to any caller is the absolute path to `00-index.md`. See `artifact-pyramids` skill for the specification.

## When not to use

- **Sales execution and pipeline management** — this skill owns acquisition *strategy*, not running the funnel. CRM operations (contact lookup, deal pipeline views, confirmed stage changes) belong to [crm](../crm/SKILL.md).
- **Product strategy and roadmap** — product vision, PMF, and prioritization belong to `product-strategy` and `product-methodology`.
- **Visual brand identity design** — logo, palette, and brand systems belong to `brand-designer`.
- **Marketing campaign execution** — this skill defines the channel strategy and positioning; operating the channel tools is the corresponding tool skill's job.
