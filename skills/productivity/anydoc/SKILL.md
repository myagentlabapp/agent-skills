# Any Doc — office documents to GitHub-Flavored Markdown

The `anydoc` skill converts office documents, spreadsheets, presentations,
ebooks, CSV, and text-based PDFs into GitHub-Flavored Markdown using the pinned
Any Doc CLI (`@firecrawl/anydoc` v0.1.6). One shared document model and one GFM
serializer produce the same logical output across formats, and conversion runs
locally in milliseconds — no service, no API key, no file upload.

## Overview

Load this skill when a task needs the *contents* of a document the agent cannot
read directly: a Word report to summarize, a spreadsheet to turn into a table,
a slide deck to extract, a CSV to analyze, or an ebook or PDF to quote from.

The skill ships a small Python helper (`scripts/anydoc`) that wraps the pinned
CLI and adds input pre-validation, friendly error hints, batch conversion, and
`--dry-run`/`--json` output. Every recipe in [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md)
also shows the raw `npx` invocation, so the skill works with or without the
helper.

## First-use decision gate

Before invoking anydoc, classify the request:

| If the user needs... | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| The contents of an existing supported document | Continue to [Command Map](#command-map). |
| Generation, editing, validation, EPUB packaging, HTML scraping, OCR, or password decryption | Stop and use the route in [When not to use](#when-not-to-use). |
| A format-fidelity or failure decision | Load the matching row in [Reference Routing](#reference-routing) before choosing a command. |
| A conversion result | Choose stdout, `-o`, or batch; run it; then follow [Verification](#verification). |

> **Hard boundary:** anydoc reads existing supported documents to Markdown. It does not create, edit, validate, package, OCR, decrypt, or scrape them.

## When to use

- **Convert a document to markdown** — Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OpenDocument,
  RTF, EPUB, CSV, or text-based PDF.
- **Extract structure** — headings, GFM tables, slide titles, speaker notes
  (as blockquotes), and footnotes.
- **Feed documents to an LLM** — one-pass conversion to clean markdown for
  summarization, extraction, or retrieval ingestion.
- **Batch a folder** — convert a directory of mixed office files for a vault
  or knowledge base.
- **Read a document from stdin** — pipe bytes into `anydoc -`.

## Format coverage (summary)

anydoc covers **8 format families / 21 extensions** through **12 canonical
parsers**. The canonical formats are `doc, docx, odt, pdf, ppt, pptx, rtf,
epub, xlsx, ods, odp, csv`; extension aliases map through them (`.docm`→docx,
`.xls`→xlsx, `.pptm`→pptx, and so on).

| Family | Extensions | Expected GFM output | Decision cue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Word | `.doc` `.docx` `.docm` | `#`–`######` headings, GFM tables, `[^n]` footnotes | Use when content extraction is enough; use `documents` when rendered layout matters. |
| PowerPoint | `.ppt` `.pps` `.pot` `.pptx` `.pptm` `.ppsx` `.ppsm` | slide titles as plain paragraphs, bullet lists, speaker notes as `>` blockquotes, GFM tables (PPTX/ODP; legacy `.ppt` flattens tables to text lines) | Need table fidelity? Prefer PPTX or ODP; legacy `.ppt` preserves cell text but not table structure. |
| Excel | `.xls` `.xlsx` `.xlsm` `.xlsb` | `## <sheet name>` heading + one GFM table per worksheet; number formats dropped (raw cell values) | Need displayed percentages, currency, or number formats? Prefer ODS; XLS/XLSX output is raw values. |
| OpenDocument | `.odt` `.ods` `.odp` | same document/slide shapes as DOCX/PPTX; ODS keeps formatted display values | Prefer ODS when spreadsheet display formatting is part of the meaning. |
| Rich Text Format | `.rtf` | same document shape as DOCX/ODT | Use for text extraction, not layout preservation. |
| EPUB | `.epub` | `#` chapter headings, GFM tables, internal anchor links | Use to read an existing EPUB; use `epub` to author or package one. |
| CSV | `.csv` | one GFM table; label-like first row promoted to header; delimiter sniffing; UTF-16 with BOM | Use for delimited tabular content; inspect delimiter and encoding when output looks wrong. |
| PDF | `.pdf` | headings + inline emphasis, but a lower-fidelity pipeline: tables flatten to text, footnotes and links degrade. **Scanned or image-only PDFs fail** — anydoc does not OCR | Use only for text-based PDFs; route scanned PDFs to OCR and treat tables as lower fidelity. |

See [references/formats.md](references/formats.md) for the full per-format
expectations and fidelity caveats, and [references/errors.md](references/errors.md)
for the exact failure messages (including the no-OCR error).

## Command Map

Commands are shown relative to the repository root. `<file>` is any document
path (for example `anydoc/fixtures/fixture-handmade-outline.docx`); `-` reads
the document from stdin.

| Need | Command | Choose it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Convert one file to small markdown on stdout | `anydoc/scripts/anydoc convert <file>` | The caller needs immediate content and does not need a saved artifact. |
| Convert one file to a markdown file | `anydoc/scripts/anydoc convert <file> -o out.md` | The output is large, must be reviewed later, or should be preserved as an artifact. |
| Convert many files to a directory | `anydoc/scripts/anydoc batch <file1> <file2> ... --out-dir out/` | The request is a bounded batch and per-file output/status is useful. |
| Show the tool and pinned CLI version | `anydoc/scripts/anydoc info` | You need to confirm the executable and version before troubleshooting or reporting an environment issue. |
| Raw pinned CLI, one document | `npx -y @firecrawl/anydoc@0.1.6 <file> [-o out.md]` | The wrapper is unavailable; preserve the pinned CLI and its documented semantics. |
| Raw pinned CLI, read stdin | `cat data.csv \| npx -y @firecrawl/anydoc@0.1.6 - --format csv` | Bytes already arrive on stdin and the format is known; keep the producer pipeline separate from the converter. |

Notes:

- `scripts/anydoc` is an executable Python 3 script (shebang `#!/usr/bin/env
  python3`); `python3 anydoc/scripts/anydoc ...` is equivalent when the
  executable bit is unavailable.
- The raw `npx -y @firecrawl/anydoc@0.1.6` rows are the ground truth for
  conversion behavior; the wrapper delegates to exactly that command.
- Always pin `@0.1.6` for reproducible conversions. `-y` answers npx's
  "Ok to proceed?" prompt non-interactively — the CLI itself never prompts.
- Both forms share the same contract: one document per invocation, exit code
  `0` success / `1` conversion or IO failure / `2` usage error, diagnostics as
  exactly one `anydoc: <message>` line on stderr, and no prompts.

## Reference Routing

Load only the row that answers the immediate question; the command examples and verification contract remain in this file.

| When you need to... | Load | It answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Choose a format or predict fidelity | [references/formats.md](references/formats.md) | Supported families, output shapes, and caveats such as raw XLSX values, ODS display values, legacy `.ppt` table flattening, and PDF degradation. |
| Select flags, stdin syntax, output behavior, or version details | [references/cli-reference.md](references/cli-reference.md) | Verbatim help, accepted options, stdin rules, stdout/stderr behavior, pinning, and runtime requirements. |
| Classify a failure or decide whether to retry | [references/errors.md](references/errors.md) | Exit codes, exact error vocabulary, no-OCR/encryption boundaries, and the next route. |
| Choose a single-file, stdin, batch, vault, or large-output recipe | [references/workflows.md](references/workflows.md) | End-to-end recipes, safe output handling, per-file failure routing, and resource-limit behavior. |
| Verify a documented upstream or fixture claim | [references/sources.md](references/sources.md) | Source URLs, access dates, fixture provenance, and the verification basis for documented claims. |
| Shape the final evidence report | [references/report-examples.md](references/report-examples.md) | Complete success, expected-failure, and fidelity-boundary reports to imitate after following Verification. |

## When not to use

Use this routing table before reaching for a conversion command:

| User's request | Reach for | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate, edit, inspect rendered layout, or validate a PDF/Word/Excel/PowerPoint artifact | `documents` skill | anydoc extracts existing document contents to Markdown; it does not author, preserve rendered layout, or validate artifacts. |
| Package or author an EPUB | `epub` skill | anydoc reads an existing EPUB to Markdown but never writes or validates an EPUB container. |
| OCR a scanned or image-only PDF | OCR tooling or the hosted Firecrawl Parse API | anydoc has no OCR path; report the documented unsupported error and do not retry locally. |
| Scrape HTML or other web content | A web-scraping skill | HTML is not a supported anydoc input. |
| Transcribe binary media such as images, video, or audio | A media or transcription tool | Embedded images become alt text; anydoc cannot transcribe media. |
| Preserve pagination, fonts, templates, or rendered layout | A document/layout tool | The only output contract is GitHub-Flavored Markdown. |
| Convert a password-protected file | An unencrypted copy from the document owner | anydoc has no password or decryption option. |

## Verification

**Report evidence, not just success.** For every attempted conversion, return the input, exact command or wrapper path, observed exit code, output destination (stdout or file), structural markers checked, and any documented caveat or next route.

**Compact report shape:**
```text
Input: <path or stdin source>
Command: <exact wrapper or pinned CLI path>
Exit: <observed code>
Output: <stdout or destination file>
Checks: <markers or fidelity facts observed>
Caveat/route: <documented limitation or next action>
```

### Common stop conditions

| Condition | Do not | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scanned or image-only PDF / OCR-required error | Retry the same file locally | Route to OCR tooling or the hosted Firecrawl Parse API. |
| Encrypted or password-protected document | Guess a password or retry unchanged | Request an unencrypted copy or owner-authorized re-export. |
| Unsupported, malformed, or resource-limit error | Guess a parser or claim partial success | Match the exact error in [references/errors.md](references/errors.md) and follow its bounded route. |
| Exit 0 but expected structural markers are absent | Report success from the exit code alone | Inspect the output shape and source fidelity before reporting completion. |

Confirm a conversion before reporting it as done:

1. **Check the exit code.** `0` means the CLI produced markdown. `1` means the
   document could not be read or converted — read the single `anydoc: <message>`
   stderr line and match it against [references/errors.md](references/errors.md).
   `2` means the command itself was a usage error (bad flag, missing input,
   invalid `--format`).
2. **Check the output shape.** The markdown must contain the structural markers
   your format actually produces:
   - Word / ODT / RTF / text-based PDF: `#`/`##` headings. For PDF, do not
     expect GFM tables or `[^1]:` footnote definitions — that pipeline
     flattens them.
   - Spreadsheets (xlsx/xls/ods) and CSV: `|`-delimited GFM tables. xlsx/xls
     show raw cell values (`0.155`, `1234.5`); ODS shows formatted display
     values (`15.5%`, `$1,234.50`).
   - Presentations (pptx/odp): slide titles as plain paragraphs, `>`
     blockquote speaker notes, GFM tables. Legacy `.ppt` flattens tables to
     bare text lines.
   - EPUB: `#` chapter headings and internal anchor links.
3. **Write large outputs to a file with `-o`.** `-o out.md` keeps stdout silent
   and gives a reviewable file instead of streaming the whole document into
   context.
4. **Verify tables survived.** If the source had tables and the output has no
   `|` rows, consult the format caveats — PDF and legacy `.ppt` flatten tables
   by design, not by error.

**Stop when** the conversion exits 0 and the structural markers match the
source format. Do not re-run or retry on a documented failure mode (encrypted,
malformed, scanned/image-only, unsupported) without changing the input; report
the documented message and route as [references/errors.md](references/errors.md)
instructs.
