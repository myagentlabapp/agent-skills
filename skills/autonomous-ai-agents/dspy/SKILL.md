# DSPy Expert Skill

DSPy is a **compiler for prompt programs**, not a chain or RAG framework. You write Python programs with typed signatures and DSPy optimizes the prompts automatically.

> **⚠️ DSPy is NOT a chain framework.** It does not use `prompt | model | parser`. It does not have LCEL. DSPy operates at a different layer: you define a program with Python control flow and typed signatures, then the *compiler* optimizes the prompts against a metric. If you reach for DSPy expecting LangChain-style composition, you are reaching for the wrong tool.

Think of it as PyTorch for LMs — you define the architecture, the compiler tunes the weights (prompts).

## Core Paradigm

> Read this first. It is the most important thing to understand about DSPy.

```python
import dspy

# 1. Configure the LM
lm = dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

# 2. Define a signature (input/output schema)
class QASignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions concisely."""
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    answer: str = dspy.OutputField()

# 3. Build a program using modules
qa = dspy.ChainOfThought(QASignature)

# 4. Compile against a metric
optimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=dspy.answer_exact_match)
compiled_qa = optimizer.compile(qa, trainset=trainset, num_trials=25)

# 5. Use the compiled program (portable artifact)
answer = compiled_qa(question="What is DSPy?").answer
```

## Core Principles

1. **DSPy is a compiler, not a chain framework.** You define the program structure with Python control flow and typed signatures. The compiler optimizes the prompts. This is fundamentally different from LangChain's explicit prompt composition.

2. **Signatures define the task.** Input/output field pairs with optional descriptions are the task definition. The syntax is `input1, input2 -> output1, output2`.

3. **Modules are program components.** `dspy.Predict` (direct), `dspy.ChainOfThought` (reasoning), `dspy.ReAct` (tool-use), and custom `dspy.Module` subclasses. Compose them with Python control flow (if/for/while).

4. **Optimizers tune prompts, not weights.** A dozen optimizers (teleprompters) tune instructions, few-shot demos, or both. Selection depends on bottleneck and budget. See the optimizer cheat sheet.

5. **Compile once, serve many.** Compilation is expensive ($3-$300+). The output is a portable artifact via `program.save(path)`. Inference is cheap.

6. **Cache aggressively.** DSPy caches all LM calls by default. Set `DSPY_CACHEDIR` for the current client. Disable with `dspy.LM(..., cache=False)`.

## Where to Start

| You already have... | Start here |
|---|---|
| Nothing — exploring DSPy | Understand the paradigm (read this page first), then build a simple Predict program |
| A working prompt you want to optimize | Port to a DSPy Signature, add ChainOfThought, compile with BootstrapFewShot |
| A multi-step pipeline | Build as a custom dspy.Module with Python control flow, compile with MIPROv2 |
| An agent/tool-use task | Use dspy.ReAct with tools, compile with GEPA or AvatarOptimizer |
| Comparing frameworks | See the Framework Routing Guide |

## Framework Routing Guide

| Scenario | Reach for | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Prompt optimization / compiled programs | **DSPy** | Only framework that auto-optimizes prompts against a metric |
| Documents to query / RAG | **LlamaIndex** | Data ingestion and retrieval are first-class primitives |
| Chain/agent composition | **LangChain** | LCEL is the cleanest pipe-based composition model |
| State-machine multi-agent | **LangGraph** | Graph topology, subgraphs, human-in-the-loop |
| Search pipelines | **Haystack** | Pipeline model is more mature for search workloads |
| Role-based teams | **CrewAI** | Higher-level agent abstraction |

## When NOT to Use DSPy

- Simple single-prompt application — raw API calls are simpler
- Need pre-built application modules (PDF Q&A, text-to-SQL) — use LlamaIndex or LangChain
- One-shot task with no optimization budget — DSPy's compiler overhead won't amortize
- Real-time latency-critical — compilation happens at development time but adds no inference overhead
